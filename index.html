            <h1>About</h1>
            I hail from a simple town in Kannur Kerala, currently pursuing my Bachelors at College of Engineering Chengannur as Computer Science & Engineering, Allapuzha. I’d try the best of my ability to organise and prioritise the assigned work. I’d network and connect with more volunteers and get them to participate in more initiatives. I’d engage more people with the social media postings about activities through sharing especially by writing blogs so that I can let them know about each and every event. But you would mostly find me working towards National Service Scheme, A Non-Profit Organisation and IEEE, a Professional Organisation. I have a determined mind to accomplish my goals
